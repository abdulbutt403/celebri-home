            This Privacy Notice, applies to the processing of personal
            information by CelebriLinks as a controller. When we talk about
            CelebriLinks acting as a “controller”, we mean that CelebriLinks
            determines the purpose and the means of the processing (i.e. we make
            decisions about how we will handle your personal information).
            Because of the nature of our services, we can also act as a
            “processor” on behalf of CelebriLinks Users. This means that, when
            we are instructed by a CelebriLinks User, we can facilitate
            processing of Profile Visitors’ and Subscribers’ personal
            information on behalf of that CelebriLinks User (“
            <strong>Processor Services</strong>“). This Privacy Notice does not
            address Processor Services. If you are a Profile Visitor or
            Subscriber, and want to know how a CelebriLinks User handles your
            personal information, please get in touch with the CelebriLinks User
            directly and/or refer to any privacy notice on the relevant User
            Profile.

          <p>
            If you provide us with information about another person (if, for
            example, you are a representative of an individual), you must
            provide them with a copy of this Privacy Notice and let that other
            person know that we use their personal information in the ways set
            out in this Privacy Notice.

          <p>
            The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls
            into the following categories:

              provide your name and email address so that we can respond to your
              queries. If you are making an Intellectual Property Report or
              Counter Notice, we ask you to provide your name, address, email

              date of birth or age, or other personal information in order to
              access elements of a User Profile (such as locked content). We may
              use the results of such access (i.e. successful or unsuccessful
              access attempts) to produce aggregated statistics for our own
              internal purposes and to improve the CelebriLinks Services.You may
              also provide personal information voluntarily if you respond to
              our surveys, marketing materials, or through your participation in

            for processing personal information
          </h4>
          <p>
            Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information
            described above will depend on the personal information concerned
            and the specific circumstances in which we collect it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we will normally collect personal information from you only
            where we have your consent, where we need the personal information
            to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our
            legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection
            interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may
            also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from
            you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your
            vital interests or those of another person.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
            requirement we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise
            you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory
            or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not
            provide your personal information). As indicated above, we require
            certain personal information to enter into a contract with you as a
            CelebriLinks User. Without your personal information, we will be
            unable to provide you with CelebriLinks Services available to
            CelebriLinks Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our
            legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest
            will normally be to develop and improve the CelebriLinks Services,
            to provide additional functionality, to ensure appropriate security
            or to implement sensitive content warnings and content moderation.
            We may have other legitimate interests, and if appropriate, we will
            make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate
            interests are.

            In order to facilitate paid products and/or services within the

            not store or collect your payment card details. That information is
            provided directly to our third party payment processors whose use of
            your personal information is governed by their privacy policies and
            their own terms and conditions. These payment processors adhere to
            the standards set by payment card industry data security standards

            Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa,

            Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in,
            countries other than the country in which you are a resident. These
            countries may have data protection laws that are different to the

          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, CelebriLinks may transfer personal information to the
            United States and other countries in which we do business.
            CelebriLinks may also subcontract certain activities and share your
            personal information with third parties located outside of Australia
            (which is where we are headquartered).
          </p>
          <p>
            The countries in which these organisations are located will vary,
            but, in the course of our business operations, we generally disclose
            personal information to organisations located in Australia, or the
            United States. Such transfers are made in order to provide the
            CelebriLinks Services and carry out the activities specified in this
            Privacy Notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your
            personal information will remain protected in accordance with this
            Privacy Notice and applicable data protection laws. These include
            entering into data transfer agreements between our group companies
            and these can be provided on request. We have implemented similar
            appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and
            partners and further details can be provided upon request. No
            transfer of your personal information will take place to an

            In addition we limit access to your personal information to

            While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
            personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            Therefore, we have put in place procedures to deal with any
            suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any

            As mentioned above, we do not sell personal information and we do

          <h5>4. Exercising Your California Privacy Rights</h5>
          <p>To exercise your rights, you can contact us:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>By email at support@linktr.ee</li>
            <li>
              By visiting this page on our website:{" "}
              <a href="https://linktr.ee/help/">linktr.ee/help</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to request any information about how we process, store
              or use your data or anything relating to personal information and
              privacy laws, please use our{" "}

              .
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once we receive your request, we are required to verify that you are
            the person that is the subject of the request. This verification
            process consists of matching identifying information provided by you
            with the information we have about you in our records. Upon making a
            request, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, and
            request details. A confirmation email will be sent to the email
            address you provide to begin the process to verify your identity. If
            we cannot verify your identity, we will not be able to respond to
            your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may designate an authorized agent to exercise any of the above
            privacy rights on your behalf, subject to the agent request
            requirements under California law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note, for your safety and security, we will require
            authorized agents to provide proof of consent and designation of the
            authorized agent for the purpose of making the request, and will
            require authorized agents to provide information necessary to verify
            the identity of the individual who is the subject of the request. We
            may also require that an individual verify his/her own identity
            directly with us before we respond to an authorized agent’s request.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to deny requests in certain circumstances, such
            as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent.
          </p>
          <h5>5. Do Not Track</h5>
          <p>
            California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
            browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an
            industry standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
            respond to them at this time.
          </p>
          <h5>6. California’s Shine the Light law</h5>
          <p>
            We do not share personal information with third parties for their
            direct marketing purposes absent your consent as defined by
            California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light law”). To
            opt-out of future sharing with third parties for their direct
            marking purposes, contact us at support@linktr.ee. Any such request
            must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line
            of the description and include your name, street address, city,
            state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to
            respond to one request per customer each year.
          </p>
          <h5>7. Changes</h5>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to change this Supplemental Information for
