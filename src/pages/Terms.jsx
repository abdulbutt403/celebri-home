            CelebriLinks is a content sharing platform that enables creators to
            connect their audiences with their most recent and relevant content.
            One of our core values is to pursue deliberate simplicity — so we’ve
            tried to distill our terms and conditions into their simplest form
            here.
          </p>
          <h5>Welcome to CelebriLinks!</h5>
          <p>
            It’s great to have you here. By using CelebriLinks, you agree to
            these Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) and the other policies that
            we link to here and on the Platform.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            These Terms (and the policies we link to) apply to your use of our
            website (<a href="https://linktr.ee/">https://linktr.ee/</a>), apps
            and any other software or features provided in connection with our
            services (collectively the “Platform” or “CelebriLinks”). When we
            say “we”, “our” or “us” in these Terms, we’re referring to
            CelebriLinks Pty Ltd (ABN 68 608 721 562) and our group companies.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            Please read these Terms carefully and reach out if you have any
            questions. If you don’t agree with them, please don’t use
            CelebriLinks.
          </p>
          <h5>Your account</h5>
          <p>
            To create an account and become a CelebriLinks user, you must be at
            least 18. If you’re creating an account on behalf of someone else,
            you must have their permission to do so. You’re responsible for your
            account and using it in a lawful way.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            When you create an account, you agree to comply with these Terms and
            that you’re (i) over 18, and (ii) legally able to enter these Terms
            with us. You must provide us with accurate info about yourself — if
            anything changes, please let us know so we can update your details.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            If you’re using CelebriLinks on behalf of a business or individual,
            you agree that you’re authorised by them to act and agree to these
            Terms on their behalf.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            You’re responsible for anything that happens to your account, so
            keep your login details and password safe and don’t share them with
            anyone. If you think your account has been compromised, please
            contact us immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            You must not assign or transfer your account to someone else, or use
            your account (or allow it to be used by anyone) in a way which in
            our reasonable opinion, causes damage to CelebriLinks or our
            reputation, or infringes another’s rights or applicable laws and
            regulations.
          </p>
          <h5 style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Your username</h5>
          <p style={{ fontSize: "clamp(20px, 2vmin, 20px)" }}>
            The username you choose must be appropriate for everyone and cannot
            infringe someone else’s rights.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            We know the username you choose is very important to you. But it’s
            also important that your username is appropriate for all audiences
            and doesn’t infringe anyone’s rights, including intellectual
            property rights (such as copyright and trade marks) (“IP Rights”).
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            You can’t use the name of another person (such as a celebrity),
            brand or company, have a username that is offensive, vulgar or
            obscene, or create an account with a username that you have no
            connection with just to profit from it in the future (known as
            “Domain Squatting”).
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            If any of these issues occur over your username, we’ll consider the
            circumstances reasonably and may require you to change it (and we
            may reassign it to someone else). If you refuse, we may suspend or
            cancel your account. If someone claims that your username infringes
            their IP Rights, they’ll need to complete an&nbsp;
            <a href="https://linktr.ee/s/report-ip-infringements/">
              Intellectual Property report
            </a>
            &nbsp;and you’ll have the chance to then issue a Counter Notice.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            If you’ve not signed in or added new links or had any traffic to
            your account in the last 6 months we may reclaim or reassign your
            username (but never without contacting you first).
          </p>
          <h5>Your content — what is and isn’t allowed</h5>
          <p>
            We love the variety of content that our users post on CelebriLinks!

            content. We’re not responsible for any content, products or services

            without our prior written approval.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            As a user, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive,
            non-transferable right to use the Platform to create, display, use,

            user profiles.

            any time.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            Your plan will start when you accept these Terms and continue until
            you cancel it. If you cancel a paid plan it will ordinarily continue
            until the end of your current billing cycle and then automatically
            convert to a free plan.
          </p>

            ). To the extent permitted by applicable law, payments are
            non-refundable. But we know that sometimes your requirements may
            change. So, if you’ve selected a paid plan, but cancel within 72
            hours, we may make an exception (please email us at&nbsp;

          <h5>Our fees</h5>
          <p>
            You must pay all subscription fees when they become due.
            CelebriLinks transaction fees as well as processing fees will be
            deducted automatically from the proceeds of any transactions you
            make on your profile.

                Subscription fees —&nbsp;If you’ve chosen a paid plan, you must
                pay your subscription fees when they fall due. Unless otherwise

            All subscription fees will be billed in advance on a recurring
            basis, based on your chosen billing cycle (either monthly or
            annual). Your paid plan will automatically renew under these Terms
            (as updated at the time of the renewal) at the end of your billing
            cycle unless you’ve cancelled your plan.

            You must provide a valid payment method (i.e. credit card) and
            accurate billing information when you join. In doing so, you
            authorise us to charge all fees to such payment method. If automatic
            billing fails, we’ll issue you an online invoice, which you must pay
            within the time indicated.

                will differ depending on your plan and will be set out on

            (collectively “End Users”).

            You’re solely responsible for (i) the way in which End Users use and

            laws in relation to your End Users, and all transactions between you

            part in beta testing with us). You must keep this info secret and
            secure and use reasonable measures to prevent others from accessing
            it.

          <h5>Feedback</h5>
          <p>
            We love hearing your ideas on how we can make CelebriLinks even
            better! Sometimes, we may make “beta” functionality available to you
            and seek your feedback.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            Keep in mind that if you share feedback with us, we’re free to use
            it however we like, without payment to you (or to not use it at
            all). We may from time to time make certain functionality of the
            Platform available to you in “beta” (or similar). You acknowledge
            that we are still evaluating and testing such beta functionality and
            it may not be as reliable as other parts of the Platform.

          <h5>Changes</h5>
          <p>
            CelebriLinks is constantly evolving and improving. From time to time
            we may make changes to the Platform or these Terms. If the change
            will have a significant negative impact on you, we’ll notify you
            beforehand.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            We may need to change these Terms from time-to-time to reflect
            business updates, changes to the Platform (including if we decide to
            discontinue any functionality, features or part of the Platform),
            legal or commercial reasons, or otherwise to protect our legitimate
            interests.

            We can make these changes at any time and it’s your responsibility
            to check these Terms now and then for any changes. However, if a
            change will have a material negative effect on you, we’ll use our
            best efforts to notify you at least 1 month before the change takes
            effect (e.g. via a notification on the Platform).

          <p class="medium">
            Your continued use of the Platform after any changes to the Terms is

            your account.

            Laws may apply to you or us as a result of your specific location.

            part of these Terms, those laws will take precedence to the extent
            of the inconsistency.

            any other policies we link to) make up the entire agreement between
            you and us in connection with the Platform. No other term is to be
            included, except where required by law. All implied terms except
            those implied by statute which cannot be excluded are expressly
